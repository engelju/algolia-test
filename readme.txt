playground to test the algolia api.

ressources:
- https://laracasts.com/series/search-as-a-service/

TODO:
- create interface and make algolia conform to it
- extract hardcoded keys into config file (something like dotenv)
- add service provider to index.php. there is already a template under ``App\Search``, but it wouldn't work the last time i tried
